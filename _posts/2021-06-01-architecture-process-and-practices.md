Let's explore different development process and practices.

## Test Driven Development (TDD)

Test Driven Development, or TDD, is a process of developing software where a test is written prior to writing code.

- Write a test, watch it fail.
- Write just enough code to pass the test.
- Improve the code withpout changing its behaviour.

## Domain Driven Design (DDD)

Domain Driven Design, or DDD, is an approach to development that focus on the core domain, the logic behind it, and forces collaboration between technical and nontechnical parties to improve the model.

## Behavioural Driven Development (BDD)

In TDD, the developers write the tests while in BDD the automated specifications are created by users or testers.
