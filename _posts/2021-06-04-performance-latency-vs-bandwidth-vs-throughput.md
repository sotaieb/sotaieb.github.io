Let's understund what is the difference between: Bandwidth, Latency and Throughput.

## Bandwidth

Bandwidth is the maximum amount of data being transferred from one point to another. (mb/s)

## Latency

Latency refers to the amount of time it takes for data to travel from one point to another.

## Throughput

Throughput refers to the amount of data that is being transferred over a set period of time.
If you have high bandwidth and low latency, then you have a greater throughput because more data is being transferred faster.
